# AlaraOS — Implementation Pins

These are **constraints, not technologies**. They are binding on all implementation.

1. Derived state must never become canonical truth.
2. Reality Models and Projections must be tied to Graph version **plus** synthesis version.
3. Stale derived state is a cache miss.
4. Derived values enter canon only as timestamped readings / events.
5. Events require deterministic causal ordering.
6. Authorization must gate Graph reads **before** Reality Understanding sees data.
   _Status: implemented for Reality Understanding reads — `reasoning-engine/authorized-context.ts` routes evidence through the existing `RetrievalPermissionGate` before `assembleContext`; read-boundary adapters delegate to the real Consent/Participation/AI-Act modules. **Fact resolution added** (`reasoning-engine/fact-resolver.ts`): participation resolves from canonical relationship edges, ai-act from intended use, consent via an optional `ConsentFactSource`; a required-but-unresolved fact fails closed. **Consent store wired** (`consent-store/`): `ConsentRepository` reads canonical `Consent` objects and `GraphConsentFactSource` feeds `ConsentFactSource`, so valid consent allows and revoked/expired/missing fails closed. Remaining: no consent **issuance** flow yet (Consent objects must be created elsewhere); callers opt in (register adapters + pass resolver + `requires`). See `code-concordance.md` §4._
7. Capabilities own cycle instances, **never** Objects.
8. Shared writes serialize through Object state machines.
9. Objecthood is a **design-time schema gate**, not runtime validation.
10. The cycle is **logical dependency order**, not a synchronous pipeline.
11. Persistence must support durable append-only storage and atomic write boundaries.
12. Identity Resolution requires its **own implementation spec** before production use.
13. Legal erasure must preserve audit integrity while making protected payload unrecoverable.
14. Confidence must be either canonical/composable or **explicitly** non-composable.
15. Failure Signatures must be classified as machine-evaluable predicates **or** human
    criteria before Assure automation.
